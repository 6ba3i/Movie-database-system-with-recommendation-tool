- **External API:** The Movie Database (TMDB) API
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with Jinja2 templating)
- **Environment Management:** python-dotenv for environment variables

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-movie-app.git

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    On Windows:
   
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install Dependencies:

   ```bash

   ```
   
## Firebase Setup and Service Key Instructions

1. Create a Firebase Account and Project
   - Visit the Firebase Console:
     Go to Firebase Console and sign in with your Google account.

   - Create a New Project:
     Click "Add project" and follow the prompts. Provide a project name (e.g., "My Movie App") and configure any settings you prefer.

2. Add a Web App to the Firebase Project
   - Register Your App:
     In the Firebase Console project overview, click on "Project settings" (gear icon) and under "Your apps", click the </> (Web) icon.

   - Set Up Your App:
     Follow the steps to register your web app. You will be provided with a Web API Key. Save this key â€“ you'll need it for authenticating via Firebase Auth REST API (see Configuration).

3. Enable Email/Password Authentication
   - Navigate to Authentication:
     Click on "Build" in the left-hand menu, then select "Authentication".

   - Enable Sign-In Method:
     Under the "Sign-in method" tab, enable "Email/Password" authentication.

4. Generate and Download Your Service Key
   - Go to Service Accounts:
     In your Firebase Console, click on the gear icon next to "Project Overview" and select "Project settings". Then select the "Service accounts" tab.

   - Generate New Private Key:
     Click "Generate new private key". A JSON file will be downloaded automatically.
     Important: Rename this file to serviceAccountKey.json.

   - Place the File Securely:
     Move the serviceAccountKey.json file to the root directory of your project.
     
## Configuration

1. Firebase Initialization
   In your code (firebase_service.py), use the service key for Firebase initialization:

   ```bash
   import os
   from firebase_admin import credentials, initialize_app

   # Set the path to your service account key file
   service_key_path = "serviceAccountKey.json"  # Update the path if needed

   cred = credentials.Certificate(service_key_path)
   initialize_app(cred)
   ```
2. Firebase API Key
   Replace the placeholder in your code (login route in main.py) with your Web API Key noted during app registration:
   
   ```bash
   api_key = "YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY_HERE"  # Replace this with the Firebase Web API Key
   ```
3. Running the Application
   After completing the configuration steps, start the Flask development server:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   Then, visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser to see your app in action.
